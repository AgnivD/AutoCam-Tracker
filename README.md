# AutoCam: Community Issue Tracker

Welcome!  

This repository exists **only** to collect bug reports, usability problems, and feature suggestions for the [AutoCam](https://renderrides.gumroad.com/l/autocam) Blender add-on.

- **No source code lives here.**  
  If you’d like to browse or contribute to the code, you’ll need to wait until the core repository is open-sourced.
- **No pull requests.**  
  We keep development in a private repo to avoid licensing overlap with AutoCam Pro. Please open an Issue or Discussion instead.
