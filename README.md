# AutoCam: Community Issue Tracker

Welcome!

This repository exists **only** to collect bug reports, usability problems, and feature suggestions for the [**AutoCam**](https://renderrides.gumroad.com/l/autocam) Blender add-on / Extension.

- **No source code lives here.**  
  The core repo isn’t public; this space is strictly for tracking issues and ideas.
- **No pull requests.**  
  Development happens in a private repo to avoid licensing overlap with [**AutoCam Pro**](https://www.renderrides.com/autocam-pro). Please open an [**Issue**](https://github.com/AgnivD/AutoCam-Tracker/issues/new/choose) instead.

## Before You Open an Issue

1. **Check the docs:** <https://renderrides.gitbook.io/autocam>  
2. **Update first:** Make sure you’re on the latest AutoCam (e.g., **2.0.0**) and a supported, stable release of Blender.
3. **Eliminate conflicts:** Temporarily disable other camera/rig/recording add-ons to rule out collisions.
